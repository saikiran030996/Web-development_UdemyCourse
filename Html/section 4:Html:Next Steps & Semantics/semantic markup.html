        <h1>Chicken</h1>
        <hr>
        <section>

            The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated species that arose from the red junglefowl,
            originally
            from
            Southeast
            Asia.

            <p>They have also partially hybridized with other wild species of junglefowl (the grey junglefowl, Ceylon
                junglefowl,
                and green junglefowl).[1] Rooster and cock are terms for adult male birds, and a younger male may be
                called
                a
                cockerel.
                A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen, and a sexually immature
                female
                is
                called a pullet. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs)
                or
                as
                pets.
                Traditionally, they were also bred for cockfighting, which is still practiced in some places. Chickens
                domesticated
                for
                meat are broilers, and for eggs, they are layers.</p>

        <h2>Terminology</h2>
        <hr>

        <p>An adult male is a called a cock or (in the United States) a rooster, and an adult female is called a
            hen.[9][10]

            Other terms are:

            Biddy: a newly hatched chicken[11][12]
            Capon: a castrated or neutered male chicken[a]
            Chick: a young chicken[13]
            Chook /tʃʊk/: a chicken (Australia/New Zealand, informal)[14]
            Cockerel: a young male chicken less than a year old[15]
            Dunghill fowl: a chicken with mixed parentage from different domestic varieties.[16]
            Pullet: a young female chicken less than a year old.[17] In the poultry industry, a pullet is a sexually
            immature
            chicken less than 22 weeks of age.[18]
            Yardbird: a chicken (southern United States, dialectal)[19]
            Chicken may also mean a chick (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).[20] In fact, chicken was originally
            a
            term
            only for an immature, or at least young, bird.[when?] In older sources, and still often in trade and
            scientific
            contexts, chicken as a species are typically referred to as common fowl or domestic fowl.[21]

            In Australian vernacular English the word chook provides the generic term for the species (e.g. "a cooked
            chook"
            or
            "she keeps chooks"); which enables chicken to commonly retain its original sense of a young or recently
            hatched
            bird. Chick is then rarely used to mean chicken, but is mainly used in Merriam-Webster's "Sense 1b" viz. the
            young
            of any bird.</p>

            <p>Chickens are omnivores.[26] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects, and
                even
                animals as large as lizards, small snakes,[27] or sometimes young mice.[28]

                The average chicken may live for 5–10 years, depending on the breed.[29] The world's oldest known
                chicken
                lived
                for
                16 years, according to Guinness World Records.[30]</p>

        <h3>Behavior</h3>

        <h4>Social behaviour</h4>
        <p>Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the incubation of
            eggs
            and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a pecking order,
            with
            dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from a
            flock
            causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established. Adding hens,
            especially
            younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.</p>
