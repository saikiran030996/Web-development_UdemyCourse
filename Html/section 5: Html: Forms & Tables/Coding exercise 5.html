<!-- Table Practice Exercise
It's time to get some practice with all those table-related elements! (yikes) Your goal is to create a 3x3 table, with
proper headings. (so it's really 4x3 if you count the heading cells) I've provided you with some starter data in
index.html, though you do not have to use it. Just make sure you create a 3x3 table with a row of headings at the top,
using the correct semantic elements. You are expected to use the following elements: table, thead, tr, th, tbody, and td -->
