    <p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated species that arose from the red junglefowl, originally
        from
        Southeast
        Asia. They have also partially hybridized with other wild species of junglefowl (the grey junglefowl, Ceylon
        junglefowl,
        and green junglefowl).[1] Rooster and cock are terms for adult male birds, and a younger male may be called a
        cockerel.
        A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen, and a sexually immature female
        is
        called a pullet. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) or as
        pets.
        Traditionally, they were also bred for cockfighting, which is still practiced in some places. Chickens
        domesticated
        for
        meat are broilers, and for eggs, they are layers.</p>

    <p>Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as
        of
        2018,[2] up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird. There
        are
        numerous cultural references to chickens—in myth, folklore, and religion, as well as in language and literature.
    </p>

    <p>Chicken may also mean a chick (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).[20] In fact, chicken was originally a
        term
        only for an immature, or at least young, bird.[when?] In older sources, and still often in trade and scientific
        contexts, chicken as a species are typically referred to as common fowl or domestic fowl.[21]

        In Australian vernacular English the word chook provides the generic term for the species (e.g. "a cooked chook"
        or
        "she keeps chooks"); which enables chicken to commonly retain its original sense of a young or recently hatched
        bird. Chick is then rarely used to mean chicken, but is mainly used in Merriam-Webster's "Sense 1b" viz. the
        young
        of any bird.</p>

    <h3>Behaviour</h3>
    <h4>Social behaviour</h4>
    <h4>Broodiness</h4>
    <p>Chickens are omnivores.[26] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects, and even
        animals as large as lizards, small snakes,[27] or sometimes young mice.[28]

        The average chicken may live for 5–10 years, depending on the breed.[29] The world's oldest known chicken lived
        for
        16 years, according to Guinness World Records.[30]

        Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long, flowing tails and shiny,
        pointed
        feathers on their necks (hackles) and backs (saddle), which are typically of brighter, bolder colours than those
        of
        females of the same breed. However, in some breeds, such as the Sebright chicken, the rooster has only slightly
        pointed neck feathers, the same colour as the hen's. Identification can be made by looking at the comb, or
        eventually by the development of spurs on the male's legs (in a few breeds and in certain hybrids, the male and
        female chicks may be differentiated by colour).

        Adult chickens have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb, or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin on
        either
        side under their beaks called wattles. Collectively, these and other fleshy protuberances on the head and throat
        are
        called caruncles. Both the adult male and female have wattles and combs, but in most breeds, these are more
        prominent in males. A 'muff' or 'beard' is a mutation found in several chicken breeds that causes extra
        feathering
        under the chicken's face, giving the appearance of a beard.[31]

        Domestic chickens are not capable of long-distance flight, although lighter chickens are generally capable of
        flying
        for short distances, such as over fences or into trees (where they would naturally roost). Chickens may
        occasionally
        fly briefly to explore their surroundings, but generally do so only to flee perceived danger.</p>
